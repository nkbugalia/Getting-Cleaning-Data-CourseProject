This repository contains supporting documents (R code and other files) for the course project for "Getting and Cleaning Data" course under Data Science Specilization track available on Coursera.

Dataset used for this project is: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

Files
The R code is designed so it reads all the data present in the same folder with default names, it unzips the folder into working directory and starts working on it afterwards.

CodeBook.md : It describes in breif about the variables, the data, and any transformations that were done to get the final tidy data set.

run_analysis.R : R code that can directly be imported in R studio or R interface and can be run. 

Final output of this exercis is the tidy data set in file "tidydata.txt", which was submitted directly through coursera.
